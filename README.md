# Assignement for understanding the fundamental concepts of multithreading in the context of bank transactions

This assignement is composed of 3 parts. The 1st two parts tackle notions in multithreading such as concurrent threads and synchronisation, using the synchronized keyword, locks and conditions.

The 3rd part is a simple multithreading exercice. It defines a Swing application that creates a simple GUI (Graphical User Interface) with a button. 
When the "Start" button is clicked, it toggles between "Start" and "Stop" labels. While the button is in the "Start" state, it doesn't perform any action. 
However, when in the "Stop" state, it starts a separate thread that continuously draws circles on the panel.
